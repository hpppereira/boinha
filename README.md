WaveGroupMonitor

WaveGroupMonitor is a Python-based tool designed to simulate, monitor, and analyze wave group dynamics and ship motions, including heave, pitch, and roll. This repository provides a foundation for real-time data simulation, processing, and analysis, making it ideal for marine dynamics research and applications.

Features

Data Simulation: Generates realistic heave, pitch, and roll data for testing and development.

Real-Time Monitoring: Reads and processes data in real-time via simulated or actual serial communication.

Customizable Framework: Easily adaptable for specific sensors and ship motion analysis tasks.

Expandable Analysis: Incorporate custom algorithms for wave group analysis or advanced motion dynamics.

Requirements

Python 3.8+

pyserial for serial communication

Install the required dependencies using:

pip install pyserial

Usage

Simulate Data

The simulator generates synthetic heave, pitch, and roll data and sends it over a simulated serial connection.

Run the simulator:

python simulator.py

Read Data

The reader script listens for incoming data and processes it in real-time.

Run the reader:

python reader.py

Example Output

Simulated data (sent by the simulator):

2.35,-10.23,5.67

Processed output (received by the reader):

Heave: 2.35 m, Pitch: -10.23°, Roll: 5.67°

Future Enhancements

Integration with actual ship sensors and IMU devices.

Advanced analysis tools for wave group identification and dynamics.

Data visualization for real-time insights.

Support for multiple communication protocols (e.g., UDP, TCP/IP).
